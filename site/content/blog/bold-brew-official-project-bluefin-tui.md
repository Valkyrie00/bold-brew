# Bold Brew Named Official Homebrew TUI for Project Bluefin

We're incredibly proud to announce that **Bold Brew has been selected as the official Terminal UI** for managing Homebrew in [**Project Bluefin**](https://projectbluefin.io/), a next-generation Linux desktop that serves tens of thousands of users worldwide!

## 🌊 What is Project Bluefin?

[Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) is a cutting-edge Linux desktop distribution that's part of the [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) ecosystem. Built on Fedora Atomic Desktop (formerly Silverblue), Bluefin represents the future of cloud-native desktop computing.

## 🎯 Why Bold Brew?

Bluefin's philosophy emphasizes **quality over quantity** and **user experience** above all else. The project carefully curates every tool and application that ships with the distribution, ensuring they meet high standards for usability and reliability.

From the [Bluefin documentation](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/command-line/):
